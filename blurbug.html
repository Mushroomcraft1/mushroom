        The background of this page should not be a gradient.
        <br>
        <br>
        What is happening is the body element has a backdrop-filter of blur(50vh) and is translated on the Y axis by
        -0.57px. If an element has a backdrop-filter of blur, and is not position exactly on a pixel, it may sample
        pixels outside of the page and use them in the blur. <h>This bug does not occur when in full-screen and only affects chromium-based browsers</h>, but when not
        in full screen, in my case it samples the bottom pixel of my bookmark bar creating a grey to black gradient.
        <br>
        <br>
        The colour of the background "gradient" changes depending on the colour of your chrome theme.
