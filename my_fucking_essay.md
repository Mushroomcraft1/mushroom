*I'd like to state out again I am not saying what Mushroom is good but I disagree that he should be kicked.*

Also, I'm repeating stuff I already said and I'm going to focus towards Mushroom's side since there's plenty of 'evidence' that Mushroom 'should' be kicked.

I bet most of you won't even read the whole thing. haha I wasted my time.

Also, I'm not proof reading this. Expect mistakes.

Discussion, debate and argument all mean the same thing in this... sorta essay.

"you" probably is directly towards 'Sun' and anyone who wants Mushroom gone... but mostly Sun.

Sun is the type of person to find any single way to counter an argument so I'll be free to explain any misinformations you didn't read clearly or expand my view on this (sorta) debate.

You guys *did* message crim about the situation and he did specifically say:
```
he can think what he'd like to think, but if he spreads misinformation that's a diff thing
```

From what 'misinformation' I see *and crim sees*, it really isn't 'misinformation'. Mainly, he was stating out *his own opinion* or some message humans would *naturally want to* send when they just want to be plain up toxic.

I do agree Mushroom was being toxic, but I also see toxicty on the other side. Specifically from Sun. As Mushroom stated that you are "extremists", I do see why Mushroom would think that. Even though I personally disagree with this statement, I would agree both of you have strong opposing opinions. 

Sun is 'interupting' Mushroom's messages, and Mushroom did 'shit talk' by adding unnecessary messages. These debates aren't fair at all either. 

Just because you don't agree with Mushroom's opinions doesn't mean you (Sun) have to be so toxic about it. Same goes for Mushroom. Everyone has their own perspective on how they view things.

If you understand human nature, **this is normal.** You might not view it the same way as me but this is, in fact, normal.

(Almost) no misinformation was spread. In an unbiased side, both sides are equally toxic and 'spreading misinformation' (in your definition).

`--`

Let's see the 'proof'.

```
Being really annoying, doing nothing but insult everyone with a different opinion/spreading untrue info such as calling me and pumpkin extremists

Strawmanning, using plain out wrong and illogical fallacies

Disrupting the natural peace of this server by not managing to keep up a general debate or conversation without unironically using the word "extremist" because he disagrees.

He said I was for murder and he also said I wanted to put anyone who didn't know what a figure speech was in mental asylums...

Just for the sake of why the fuck am I writing this essay, I'm gonna be ignoring the fact that some these screenshots were sent without full 'context'.

__Jokes__
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/979442187945267270/979454594834890752/unknown.png - this is definitely a joke.
https://discord.com/channels/763812938875535361/861118533395021824/969977261216387083 - this was taken way too seriously and became a 'toxic'. I can't label this to be in 2 categories though.

__I don't know how to categorize this.__
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/979442187945267270/979454365851086958/unknown.png - how is this proof.

__I would agree this would be an intentional argument but it's kinda your fault for getting into it.__

That's all the proof I got from the side that wants Mushroom kicked. You might say... 'oh. can't anything be an opinion, toxic response or a joke?'

Yes but actually no. Once again, nowhere has Mushroom spread misinformation besides *once* when he misinterpreted your opinion. ||This is a controversal topic but people haven't decided yet if this is murder or not murder. ( https://discord.com/channels/763812938875535361/861118533395021824/978839819205636096 )||

This might be excessively being 'annoying' but that's all. Most of them was Mushroom expressing his opinion. 
... and *techinally* according to Sun... if you read it in a specific way, my opinion doesn't matter. https://discord.com/channels/763812938875535361/979442187945267270/979476451193663598

You seeing anything here? Both sides aren't accepting each other's opinions. Just because of Mushroom having a differently perspective than few of you (out of the >100 people in this server), you guys find him annoying and don't want him. In one side, this would be viewed as BS. (and the other won't give a shit because they're the one throwing the BS at them.)

Think about it. Did Mushroom really break any rules? No. Absolutely not.

Nothing much to do with the discussion but:

Sun, you aren't allowing this to be a civil argument either. I agree Mushroom isn't either but... you know... that's a bit hypocritical. just saying...

---

Mushroom should *change* how he acts but he shouldn't be *kicked*. Look at all the evidence here.
Most of it shows that Mushroom has to 'change' if he wants to be 'accepted' here.

What should he change though? In a biased perspective, I would want these changes:
- Mushroom shouldn't argue.
- Mushroom shouldn't act toxic.
- Mushroom should get kicked anyways.

In my perspective, this is how I believe Mushroom should try to 'fix himself' (it isn't really fixing himself. it's just called not being able to show too much opinions) to be more fitting into your standards:
- Try to avoid arguments. When arguing, Mushroom shouldn't send these toxic responses that bring absolutely no meaning into the conversation. (same for Sun but Mushroom does this a bit more... extreme)
- State out what's a joke or not. (I personally add /j to most of my messages where I'm 'joking'.)
- He should reflect on how he acts and try to view from Sun's perspective (while considering he is a human too and why one side doesn't like him). Even though this might not be a 'perfect' way to avoid future conflicts with Mushroom, it's better than nothing.

I can add in more... but uhhhh... I should stop wasting my time on this. ngl it's kinda funny I wrote a whole... this. 

Also, I might be a bit of a hypocrite myself, but there's no point of continuing this. (unless this essay made you reconsider your decision which is highly unlikely since I'm not convincing.) you kinda... already won?
